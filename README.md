# C& 
# Compiled and Interpreted Practical Programming Language

Pronunciation: “**candy**” or “**see-and**”

# Goals 
1. Quick and easy **deployment of a minimum viable product** with the **ability to scale and stay maintainable** by opting in to **type and logic safety** incrementally.     
2. **Plug and play** on top of any C++ environment and call native C++ methods from C&. **#include “candi.h” is all you need.**  

# Design Philosophies 
1. “When there is a right way, there should be one choice. When there is no right way, there should be as many choices as possible.” 
2. “If it can happen at compile time it should happen at compile time,  unless it must happen at run time.”
